1 - Word overlapping: Check for collision at gen_word [DONE]
    -> Started using arcade.Text rather than a simple string, the Text class
    -> provides all corners of the word's bounding box (left, right, top, bottom), 
    -> and thus it made it easier to check for collisions. 

    -> The problem with this solution is the fact that I get bounding box 
    -> information after the word has been draw/display (even if not visually)
    -> thus the collison check happens in on_draw() rather than on_update(),
    -> if the last one generated collides with any other I just delete it,
    -> this is a temporary solution until I come up with a better one

2 - Blury text: Updating too fast? Blury display of words [DONE]
    -> the old code used float positioning rather than int thus
    -> making the words blury due to the decimal steps it took
    -> each frame

3 - Word stopping at leftmost x side, stopped moving and freeze [DONE]
    -> When updating the word position (moving to the left), I was rounding the value to
    -> fix the issue 2 above, but using math.ceil which rounds up to the nearest integer,
    -> thus x never lowers below 0 in some cases, depending where the random x placed it
    -> in the rightmost corner when generated, now I'm using math.floor and also the Check
    -> is to remove any word when: x <= 0, rather than: x < 0, now I made sure it reaches zero
    -> and it doesn't get stuck at the leftmost corner.
